# Dotfiles

![screenshot.png](screenshot.png)

This repository contains my personal Linux dotfiles.

I am using the Awesome window manager together with Lightdm on Arch Linux.
The theme is a based on [Awesome Copycats](https://github.com/lcpz/awesome-copycats).
My terminal emualtor of choice is Alacritty with the Gruvbox color scheme.
For detailed information, see the corresponding config files.

Programs in the screenshot:
- Vim inside Alacritty
- Neofetch
- MOC
