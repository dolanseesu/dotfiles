# Dotfiles

![screenshot.png](screenshot.png)

This repository contains my personal Linux dotfiles.
I use the Awesome window manager together with Lightdm on Arch Linux.
My terminal emualtor of choice is Alacritty with the Gruvbox color scheme.
For detailed information, see the corresponding config files.
